# 🥒 Pickle Rick: Quick Start Guide

## 1. Install & Configure

**Step 1: Install Extension**
```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/galz10/pickle-rick-extension
```

**Step 2: Update Settings**
Add this to your `~/.gemini/settings.json` to enable the agent and secure git operations:
```json
{
  "hooks": { "enabled": true },
  "experimental": { "skills": true },
  "includeDirectories": ["~/.gemini/extensions/pickle-rick"],
  "tools": {
    "exclude": ["run_shell_command(git push)"],
    "allowed": [
      "run_shell_command(git commit)", 
      "run_shell_command(git add)", 
      "run_shell_command(git diff)", 
      "run_shell_command(git status)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Launch Safely**
Always run in sandbox mode for safety:
```bash
gemini -s
```

## 2. Choose Your Mode

| Command | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/pickle "task"`** | **"Shut Up and Compute"**<br>You have a clear task and don't want questions. |
| **`/pickle-prd "idea"`** | **"Collaborative Planning"**<br>You have a complex idea and want Rick to help define the requirements first. |

## 3. Real World Examples

### The "Quick Fix" (Use `/pickle`)
**Prompt:**
```bash
/pickle "Read this github issue [PASTE CONTENT] and apply the fix. Validate by running npm run build and npm test." 
```
**Why:** The problem and solution are clear. Rick just needs to execute.

### The "New Feature" (Use `/pickle-prd`)
**Prompt:**
```bash
/pickle-prd "I want to add ZSH-style tab completion to the CLI. If I type 'ls' and tab, show files. Validate by running npm run build and npm test." 
```
**Why:** Complex UX features have "unknowns." Rick will interrogate you to define the exact behavior before coding.
